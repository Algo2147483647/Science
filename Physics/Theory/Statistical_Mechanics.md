### Zeroth law

If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

### First law

In a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy, $\Delta U$, of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat, $Q$, less the thermodynamic work, $W$, done by the system on its surroundings.
$$
\Delta U = Q-W
$$


### Second law

Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.

### Third law

As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.

## Ideal Gas

### Ideal gas law

$$
PV=nRT
$$

- $P$: pressure
- $V$: volume
- $T$: temperature
- $n$: the amount of substance
- $R$: the ideal gas constant.
