## Entropy

$$
S = k \ln(\Omega)
$$

### 最大熵原理

### Second law

Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.
$$
\mathrm{d}S \ge \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{T}
$$

### 刘维尔定理

### 温度

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}U} = \frac{1}{T}
$$



#### Zeroth law

If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
$$
\mathrm{d}U = \mathrm{d}Q - \mathrm{d}W 
$$


### 压力

### 体积

### First law

In a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy, $\Delta U$, of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat, $Q$, less the thermodynamic work, $W$, done by the system on its surroundings.
$$
\Delta U = Q-W
$$

### Third law

As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.

## Ideal Gas

### Ideal gas law

$$
PV=nRT
$$

- $P$: pressure
- $V$: volume
- $T$: temperature
- $n$: the amount of substance
- $R$: the ideal gas constant.
