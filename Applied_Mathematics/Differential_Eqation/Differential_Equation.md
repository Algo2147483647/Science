# Differential Equation

## Define

- **Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):** An equation involving a function $y(x)$ of a single variable $x$ and its derivatives. where $y'$ represents the first derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$, $y''$ the second derivative, and $y^{(n)}$ the $n$-th derivative.
  $$
  F(x, y, y', y'', ..., y^{(n)}) = 0
  $$
  
- **Partial Differential Equation (PDE):** An equation involving a function $u(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ of multiple variables and its partial derivatives. where $u_{x_i}$ denotes the partial derivative of $u$ with respect to $x_i$, and $u_{x_ix_j}$ denotes the second partial derivative of $u$ with respect to $x_i$ and $x_j$, and so on.
  $$
  F(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, u, u_{x_1}, u_{x_2}, ..., u_{x_1x_1}, u_{x_1x_2}, ..., u_{x_nx_n}, ..., u_{x_1x_1...x_n}) = 0
