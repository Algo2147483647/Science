# Free-Form Deformation


### Principle of Free-Form Deformation (FFD)

1. **Embedding in a Lattice**:
   - The algorithm starts by embedding the geometric model within a 3D lattice of control points. This lattice is usually a parallelepiped (a 3D parallelogram).
   - The lattice provides a flexible framework for manipulating the embedded model.

2. **Trivariate Bernstein Polynomials**:
   - FFD uses trivariate Bernstein polynomials to define the deformation. These polynomials allow smooth and continuous deformation over the lattice.
   - The Bernstein polynomials for a point $(s, t, u)$ in the parameter space are defined as:
     $$
     B_{i,j,k}(s,t,u) = B_i^l(s) B_j^m(t) B_k^n(u)
     $$
     where $B_i^l(s)$, $B_j^m(t)$, and $B_k^n(u)$ are the Bernstein polynomials of degrees $l$, $m$, and $n$ respectively.

3. **Control Points**:
   - The position of a point $P$ in the deformed space is determined by the control points of the lattice. If $P_{i,j,k}$ are the control points, then the deformed position $P(s,t,u)$ is given by:
     $$
     P(s,t,u) = \sum_{i=0}^l \sum_{j=0}^m \sum_{k=0}^n P_{i,j,k} B_{i,j,k}(s,t,u)
     $$
   - By moving the control points $P_{i,j,k}$, the embedded model is deformed accordingly.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Embed the geometric model within a lattice of control points.
   - Define the parameter space $(s, t, u)$ which maps the points in the geometric model to their corresponding positions in the lattice.

2. **Deformation Specification**:
   - The user specifies the desired deformation by moving the control points of the lattice.
   - The movement of these control points defines how the Bernstein polynomials modify the position of each point in the original model.

3. **Computing Deformed Positions**:
   - For each point in the geometric model, compute its new position using the weighted sum of the control points and the Bernstein polynomials.
   - The new position $P(s,t,u)$ is calculated as per the trivariate Bernstein polynomial equation mentioned earlier.

4. **Updating the Model**:
   - Update the geometric model with the new positions of its points.
   - The resulting deformed model reflects the changes specified by the control points' movement.
